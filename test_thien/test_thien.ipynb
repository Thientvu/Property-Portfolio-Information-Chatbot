      "\n",
      "Answer: To calculate the projected total cost of all roofing projects over the next five years according to the document, we need to consider both the single-year event costs and the annual maintenance costs, as well as the immediate costs mentioned. Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Replace skylights (Year 2)**: $42,000.0\n",
      "- **Annual roof maintenance including coating of corrugated metal awnings**:\n",
      "  - Year 1: $2,488.6\n",
      "  - Year 2: $2,488.6\n",
      "  - Year 3: $2,488.6\n",
      "  - Year 4: $2,488.6\n",
      "  - Year 5: $2,488.6\n",
      "  - The total for annual maintenance over five years: $2,488.6 x 5 = $12,443.0\n",
      "- **Immediate costs**:\n",
      "  - Painting yellow safety strip: $1,500.0\n",
      "  - Installation of parapet coping: $7,400.0\n",
      "  - Roof overlay with TPO: $199,088.0\n",
      "  - The total for immediate costs: $1,500.0 + $7,400.0 + $199,088.0 = $207,988.0\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding all these costs together gives us the projected total cost over the next five years:\n",
      "\n",
      "- $42,000.0 (skylights) + $12,443.0 (annual maintenance) + $207,988.0 (immediate costs) = $262,431.0\n",
