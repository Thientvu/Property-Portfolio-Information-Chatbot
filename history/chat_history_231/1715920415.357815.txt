user: give me the total maintenance cost of the entire portfolio
assistant: Due to the limitations in the retrieval process and the inability to query all projects simultaneously, it's not possible to provide the total maintenance cost of the entire portfolio at this time. Each project's maintenance cost would need to be retrieved individually, and then summed, which is beyond the scope of the current interaction capabilities.
