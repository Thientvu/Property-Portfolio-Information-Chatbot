user: What is the total cost
assistant: To find the sum of all the expenses listed, we simply need to add up all the total costs provided for each project. However, it's important to note that some costs are listed more than once, indicating duplicate entries which should be considered only once unless specified otherwise. Based on the provided data, here are the unique costs listed:

1. $15,000.0 (for 15,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
2. $250,000.0 (for 250,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
3. $26,000.0 (for 26,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
4. $13,000.0 (for 13,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
5. $9,000.0 (for 36,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
6. $82,000.0 (for 82,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
7. $66,000.0 (for 44,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
8. $28,000.0 (for 28,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
9. $10,000.0 (for 10,000 SF, mentioned twice, counted once)
10. $80,000.0 (for 80,000 SF, mentioned once)

Adding these amounts together:

$15,000 + $250,000 + $26,000 + $13,000 + $9,000 + $82,000 + $66,000 + $28,000 + $10,000 + $80,000 = **$579,000.0**

Therefore, the sum of all the expenses listed is **$579,000.0**.

Thank you for asking, Is there anything else I can help you with?
