user: How many buildings do I have
assistant: Based on the chat history provided, it appears there are four distinct project IDs mentioned (246074, 246480, 246065, 246077, and 246064), each associated with a different count of ADA-designated parking spaces. This suggests that there are at least four buildings in your portfolio, assuming each project ID corresponds to a separate building.

Thank you for asking, Is there anything else I can help you with?
user: How much do I need to cost every year
assistant: To calculate the annual cost required for maintaining your portfolio of buildings, we need to consider the total cost and the remaining useful life of the maintenance activities for each building. The provided information outlines costs for exterior maintenance, including cleaning, painting, masonry pointing, and sealing, for different buildings with varying square footage and timelines.

1. **Project 246025**: The document mentions a cost of $10,000 for 10,000 SF with 7 years remaining useful life. However, this information is repeated multiple times without clear indication if it's for different events or an error. Assuming it's a single event, the annual cost is not directly applicable since it's a single-year event planned for year 7.

2. **Project 246077**: The cost for exterior maintenance is $42,000 for 42,000 SF with 5 years remaining useful life. This information is also repeated, suggesting a potential error or duplication. Assuming a single event, the cost is planned for year 5.

3. **Project 246478**: The cost is $75,000 for 75,000 SF with 5 years remaining useful life. This is mentioned twice, indicating a possible duplication.

4. **Project 246060**: The cost is $9,000 for 36,000 SF with 5 years remaining useful life. This information is repeated multiple times, suggesting duplication.

5. **Project 246039**: The cost is $14,500 for 58,000 SF with 4 years remaining useful life, with costs planned for year 4 and year 12. This is repeated, indicating duplication.

6. **Project 246065**: The cost is $22,000 for 22,000 SF with 6 years remaining useful life, planned for year 6.

Given the information, it's not straightforward to calculate an annual maintenance cost without knowing the specific year of expenditure for each project and whether the costs are spread out annually or are one-time expenses in the specified years. Additionally, the repeated entries need clarification to ensure accuracy.

For a precise calculation, we would need to know if the costs are to be divided annually or if they represent lump sums for specific future years. Without this clarity, and given the nature of the costs as single-year event reserve items, it's challenging to provide an accurate annual maintenance cost for the entire portfolio.

If the costs are indeed one-time expenses planned for specific future years rather than annual expenses, then the annual maintenance cost would vary significantly year by year and would not be a simple division of total cost by remaining years.
